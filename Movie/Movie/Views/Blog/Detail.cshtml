                            Joss Whedon has a little bit of a history with superhero
                            movies, and for creating layered female characters. After his
                            documented frustrations with Wonder Woman, he’s getting
                            another chance at the DC Extended Universe and Warner Bros.,
                            closing in on a deal to write direct and produce a Batgirl
                            movie.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s a somewhat surprising, but welcome move, given that
                            Whedon has taken a long break to write something original, but
                            has now pivoted to focus on developing the Batgirl project.
                            First appearing in 1967 in Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino’s
                            story run The Million Dollar Debut Of Batgirl, she’s the
                            superhero alias of Barbara Gordon, daughter of Gotham City
                            Police Commissioner James Gordon. So we can likely expect J.K.
                            Simmons’ take on Gordon to appear along with other Bat-related
                            characters.

                            Based on Lissa Evans’ novel “Their Finest Hour and a Half” and
                            directed by Lone Scherfig (“An Education”), the film is set in
                            London during World War II when the British ministry was
                            utilizing propaganda films to boost morale. Arterton plays
                            Catrin Cole, a scriptwriter who is brought on to handle the
                            women’s dialogue — commonly referred to as “the nausea.” The
                            film, opening this week, features an outstanding ensemble,
                            including Bill Nighy as a washed-up actor and Sam Claflin as
                            Catrin’s fellow writer and sparring partner.

                                    Arterton is next set to play Vita Sackville-West in Vita
                                    and Virginia about her relationship with Virginia Woolf.
                                    She spoke to Variety about working with female directors,
                                    remarkable women, and why she shies away from the term
                                    “strong female character.

                                    I’m friends with the producer who I worked with on
                                    Byzantium and he sent it to me. I read the book as well,
                                    which is fantastic. You’re always looking for untold
                                    stories and many times they’re women’s stories. What
                                    surprised me is that it centers around a woman who’s
                                    really quite timid. I guess she’s allowed to be because
                                    all of the other characters.

                            Man Down debuted simultaneously on digital platforms in the
                            U.K., meaning it was never going to be a big earner in
                            theaters. But no one expected only one ticket sale. As of
                            Tuesday, the Reel Cinema in Burnley was still carrying Man
                            Down, which also stars Gary Oldman, Jai Courtney and Kate
                            Mara.
